# Restaurant-Page

For Learning Perposes.

Webpack was used as a prerequisite to learn React for this project. JavaScript and CSS were utilized, with no HTML directly included. You can view the project here:

Things that I learned using webpack.

Module Bundling: How Webpack bundles JavaScript modules into a single or multiple files, handling dependencies between modules.
Loaders: Using loaders to preprocess files before they are bundled, such as transpiling JavaScript with Babel, or handling CSS and images.
Plugins: Utilizing plugins to extend Webpackâ€™s functionality, like optimizing bundle size, generating HTML files, or extracting CSS into separate files.
Entry Points: Configuring entry points to define where Webpack starts the bundling process.
Output Configuration: Setting up the output configuration to determine where and how the bundled files are emitted.
Code Splitting: Implementing code splitting to optimize loading times by splitting the code into smaller chunks that are loaded on demand.
Tree Shaking: Understanding tree shaking to remove unused code from your final bundle, helping reduce bundle size.
Hot Module Replacement (HMR): Enabling hot module replacement for live reloading of modules without a full page refresh during development.
Development vs. Production Modes: Configuring different settings for development (e.g., detailed source maps, live reloading) and production (e.g., minification, optimization) environments.
Configuration File: Writing and managing the webpack.config.js file to define rules, plugins, and various settings.
Asset Management: Handling various assets such as images, fonts, and other files, and including them in the bundle.
Environment Variables: Using environment variables to manage different configurations for development, testing, and production environments.
Source Maps: Generating source maps for debugging to map the bundled code back to the original source code.
Caching: Configuring caching strategies to improve performance by caching the output files and managing cache busting.
DevServer: Setting up Webpack DevServer for local development, providing features like live reloading and serving files from memory.
